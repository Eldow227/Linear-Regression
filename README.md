This mini-project uses the classic tips.csv dataset from Seaborn—yes, the one everyone’s seen before 😊—to build a model that predicts how much tip someone might leave. It’s a fun and slightly tricky dataset that makes you try a few different approaches and troubleshoot as you go.

💡 What’s in the repo?
You’ll find a few files here, each covering a different part of the analysis:

The main code (Python/Jupyter Notebook style), where I explore, model, and comment my thought process.

The dataset itself (tips.csv), which is also easy to load directly via sns.load_dataset("tips")—it’s got 244 rows and 7 columns (like total bill, tip, sex, smoker, day, time, and party size)

🔍 What I Did
Explored the data – Checked distributions, looked for trends (e.g., do bigger bills get bigger tips?).

Tried different models – Tested everything from simple regression to more advanced methods to see what sticks.

Cleaned and commented – Every step has my written reasoning so you can see why I made certain choices.

Made it shareable – Everything’s ready to go in Google Colab. Just upload the notebook (and tips.csv if you like), run each cell, and play around.
