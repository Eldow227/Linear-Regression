In this branch I try to predict future tip using tips.csv dataset.
You can find a few files here, which are parts of this analysis.




Tips.csv is very popular dataset which can be uploded using seaborn library. I decided to choose it because it is very interesting dataset, and not the easiest one. You need to try many approaches here, and sometimes problems occur.
I hope to present my modeling skills by trying to create efficient model on this dataset. 

In every file you will find code of course but also comments to present and explain my thinking and actions.
If you want, you can always open these files in google colaboratory and see how it works.
